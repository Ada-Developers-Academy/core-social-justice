# Self-Accountability Work Towards Allyship

[Workshop Presentation Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE5IGiqcys/EACMXz73xG0QRmoDQgCMAw/view) 

- **Start with self-reflection/awareness**
  - What is your power, privilege and positionality? What needs to be learned or unlearned?
  - Allyship is not about you or fixing your guilt
  - Reference your pre-course [Identify Wheel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ia6h_OI40Spi7mghK72DtUfT0VOrmUUr/edit) 
- **Self-research/work- constantly**
  - Educate yourself on history of an issue
  - Figure out how you engage and perpetual oppressive systems
  - Practice active listening
  - You do not get to name yourself an ‘ally’ to folks
- **Requires action**
  - Spread knowledge- focus on those of a similar background; do not tap the energy of the marginalized
  - Uplift the marginalized- amplify voices of the oppressed before centering your own voice
- **Expect mistakes and improve when mistakes are made**
  - Don’t: 
    - Deny or derail an experience
    - Tone police folks
    - Blame folks
    - Withdraw for your own comfort
  - Do:
    - Own your mistakes, and apologize for the impact
    - Center the impacted folks- listen to their response and learn
    - Change your behavior
    - Stop the pattern of this behavior
- **Work is ongoing**
  - Allies don’t get to take breaks- take on the hard work for marginalized groups and lean into discomfort when privileged 
- **Reflect on the following questions:**
  - How can I give allyship to others?
  - What resources do I need/have to get there?
 
### Allyship: A Glossary
  - **Allyship:** A role "choice" both visible and behind the scenes as a friend, advocate, supporter, champion, mentor, or sponsor with whatever marginalized groups need to be elevated. An active commitment of using privilege to support marginalized groups through access and opportunities. All of us can be an ally. Allyship is a spectrum. Allyship is authentic, not performative. 
  - **Implicit Bias:** Unconscious or hidden bias, implicit biases are negative associations that people unknowingly hold.
  - **Performative Allyship:** Self-centering. Names oneself an ‘ally’ by simply sharing trending information or slogans—without the necessary research, action or self-reflection.
  - **Privilege:** Unearned social, physical or economic power accorded by the formal and informal institutions of society to ALL members of a dominant group.
  - **Positionality:** The identities and privileges we hold in the context of where we are and what we do. Privilege and marginalization are not absolute, but they are experienced and enacted differently in different social and cultural contexts.
  - **Power:** Aspects of our identities we do not have control over (typically, things we were born with) which give us advantages in society and we can access to direct or influence the behavior of others, oneself, and/or the course of events.
  - **Unlearning:** Interrogating one’s own conscious and unconscious biases, recognizing how these may have come about as the result of particular identities, privileges or positions held—and taking conscious steps to counter those biases in future actions.
  - **Active Listening:** Listening without judgment, with the intention to fully understand and reflect upon what is being said. Active listening centers the experience of the speaker and is crucial to engaging respectfully as an ally.
  - **Apologizing:** A good apology should not only express regret for past actions or inactions; it should also explicitly acknowledge who has been affected and articulate plans for future improvement. A pattern of this behavior should stop.
