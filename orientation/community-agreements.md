# Community Agreements

In this space, we encourage folks to be vulnerable while we explore potentially sensitive topics. We acknowledge that one’s ability to be vulnerable is often determined by one’s ability to feel safe. In order to build this safe space, we are outlining community agreements below that everyone should review and honor during our time together. 

Please note that this is a living document. We welcome continual input from this community to make sure these agreements work for everyone.

## Below are Community Values & Agreements to hold ourselves to individually and collectively at at Ada
 
**Vulnerability builds trust** – if it feels safe, please express your needs with the group speak your truth 

**Use “I” statements and speak from personal experience** – do not presume to be able to speak for others

**Commit to listen for understanding** – understand differences and dissent

**Learn and grow in this work** – stay engaged in learning; come having done your own research and work  

**Transparency** – both implicit/explicit 

**Make no assumptions and ask questions** 

**Treat each other - and ourselves- with kindness** – understand and reconcile missteps with compassion

**Foster clear and open communication between participants** 

**Acknowledge and validate the lived experience of marginalized folks** 

**Assume positive intent** – acknowledge and address impact on community

**Experience discomfort** – not every conversation will be easy; healthy conflict leads to growth

**Commit to doing our best work together to achieve our goals** – compromise will be needed

**Be aware of your personal power and privilege** – remember how these show up and have the ability to influence decisions that impact others; acknowledge space that you take up

**Expect and accept non-closure**

**Welcome differing perspectives**

**What’s said here stays here, what’s learned here leaves**

**If you experience feelings of guilt as a white ally/accomplice or ally, please redirect your needs** – keep focus on actions
